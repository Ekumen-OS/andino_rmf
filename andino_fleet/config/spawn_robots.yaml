# This file configures the robots that spawn on the simulation and sets the position of each one.
# The configuration values should follow the next pattern:

# name_of_robot:
#    x:
#    y:
#    z:
#    yaw:

# Take into account that the values for the x, y and z fields depend on the simulation environment.
