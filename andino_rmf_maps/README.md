# RMF Maps Package
This package contains the resources used by RMF Traffic Editor to create a simulation and a navigation graph.

These files include:
- A 2D map for the andino office world named *andino_office.png*
- An annotated file generated by the traffic editor named *andino_office.building.yaml*
- A SLAM map named *office_map.png*

## Usage
Compile this package to obtain a world file and navgraph which are required by a fleet adapter.

```
colcon build --packages-select andino_rmf_maps
```

Once being compiled, world file and navgraph will be generated inside the shared folder automatically.
